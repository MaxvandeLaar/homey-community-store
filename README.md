# Homey Community Store

The Homey Community store is the alternative store for installing app on your Homey. You can find the store here: [https://store.homey.community](https://store.homey.community)

If you enjoy the app and can spare a few coins... hosting the store sadly isn't free and it would help me to keep it ads free.

## Important
This repo does not include any active code anymore and is purely meant for bug reports and feature requests.

## How to get your app listed
Message me on Slack [@MaxvandeLaar](https://homeyusers.slack.com/archives/DUV9LK6RF).
 
The app needs to conform to the same standards as official apps. As long as it runs and has the required files, it will be accepted. No matter if it's a duplicate or too complex app ðŸ˜Š  

## Developers wanted!

* Would you like to contribute to this project besides donating?

If you answer yes, please message me on Slack [@MaxvandeLaar](https://homeyusers.slack.com/archives/DUV9LK6RF).

* You don't know how to program?

Do you know how to ask for help and how to use Google? Most devs are just really good at using Google and I have learned that most Homey apps aren't written by professional developers. I am more than happy to assist you while you help improve the HCS!
