# Homey Community Store

The Homey Community store is a desktop (MacOS/Windows) app that brings the user and developer together! The Community Store provides an easy way for users to side-load apps while it allows access to almost every Homey app out there.

## How to install it
Just download your OS corresponding release here [https://github.com/MaxvandeLaar/homey-community-store/releases/latest](https://github.com/MaxvandeLaar/homey-community-store/releases/latest) and run the executable.

Please note that I did not sign the app as I am not willing to pay full price for Microsoft and Apple certificates so you might need to allow the app to run. It is definitely safe.

## How to get your app listed
Just create an issue or you can create a pull request and add your repo here [https://github.com/MaxvandeLaar/homey-community-store/blob/master/src/assets/apps.json](https://github.com/MaxvandeLaar/homey-community-store/blob/master/src/assets/apps.json). The app needs to conform to the same standards as official apps. As long as it runs and has the required files, it will be accepted. No matter if it's a duplicate or too complex app ðŸ˜Š  

### Development info

#### Develop
Just clone the repo and run `npm install`. Now you can use `npm start` to start the dev app. 

#### Building
So this is a bit of a pain and probably caused by some bad webpack config.

This all applies if you are working on MacOS Catalina (not yet configured for different development OS). 

##### MacOS

Just run `npm run make:darwin` and you are done.

##### Linux (dep/rpm)


Just run `npm run make:linux` and you are done.

##### Windows
If you are developing on MacOS just run `npm run make:win:mac`. If not, sorry Windows, you are on your own... Linux you probably can figure it out yourself ;)  


#### IMPORTANT for deployment
As of version 0.2.0 there is an auto-update mechanism in place. This requires a zip file called update-source.zip to be present in the github release. 

You only have to run one of these. However, you can only run this after building at least for one OS. Run the corresponding command for the OS platform you at least have build.
- `npm run make:update:darwin` 
- `npm run make:update:linux` 
- `npm run make:update:win`
